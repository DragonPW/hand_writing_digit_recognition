# hand_writing_digit_recognition
machine learning test
- This project is to re-do the machine learning problem in my undergraduate courses.
- The code is run in matlab to help me recall the machine learning stuffs.
- The next step is to do the code with google TensorFlow.

Project description:
- Compare different machine learning algorithms in the toy example of hand-wirting-digit-recognition.
- targeted recognition successful rate is above 98%.
